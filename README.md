# IoT-Greenhouse-Simulation-Project

This project aims to implement a network simulation of greenhouse setup using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network is formed by connecting various sensors to monitor the greenhouse environment. The sensors used include a temperature sensor, humidity sensor, soil moisture sensor, and CO2 detector. A solar cell is used as the energy generator in the designed system, and a smart door system is implemented to control access.
